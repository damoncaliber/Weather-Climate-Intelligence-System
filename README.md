# Weather-Climate-Intelligence-System
This project leverages real-time and historical weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** to analyze temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed across selected global cities.   It aims to extract environmental insights, identify patterns, and forecast climate behavior using Python automation and time-series modeling.

###  Project Overview

This project leverages real-time and historical weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** to analyze temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed across selected global cities.  
It aims to extract environmental insights, identify patterns, and forecast climate behavior using **Python automation and time-series modeling**.

The end goal is to demonstrate how **data automation**, **API integration**, and **forecast analytics** can drive smarter decision-making in **urban planning, agriculture, and sustainability**.

## Project Objectives

1. **Automate data retrieval** from the OpenWeatherMap API across multiple cities.
2. **Analyze temporal and spatial trends** in temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind.
3. **Detect anomalies** such as heatwaves or extreme precipitation.
4. **Forecast climate metrics** using ARIMA/SARIMA models.
5. **Compare climate dynamics** between global regions.
6. **Deliver actionable insights** for planning and environmental resilience.

   #### Analytical Questions

### Data Quality & Overview
- How consistent and complete is the collected weather data?
- What is the time coverage and frequency of readings?
- Are there missing values or irregular intervals?

### Temperature & Seasonal Patterns
- What are the average monthly temperatures across cities?
- How do seasonal temperature patterns differ by region?
- Which cities experience the highest volatility or extremes?

### Rainfall & Humidity Insights
- How do rainfall patterns shift across months or climate zones?
- Are humidity levels correlated with temperature or rainfall intensity?
- Which regions show abnormal precipitation behavior?

### Wind & Pressure Dynamics
- Which locations experience high wind variability?
- Are pressure changes linked to extreme weather events?

### Regional Climate Comparisons
- How do tropical, temperate, and arid zones differ in climate behavior?
- What similarities or differences exist between northern and southern hemispheres?

### Forecasting & Predictive Insights
- How accurate are temperature or rainfall forecasts?
- Which regions show predictable versus volatile patterns?
- How can predictions inform weather-dependent industries?
